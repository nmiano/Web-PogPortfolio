        <p>Welcome to my personal portfolio for DIGIT 100!</p>

        <p>This website is to showcase me and what I do! I was born and raised in Erie, Pennsylvania
            and I am currently a freshman at Penn State Behrend studying DIGIT. I have been quite a
            musical kid for most of my life, playing instruments for as long as I could remember. I
            started off with the obvious choice of recorder and violin during our dumb 4th grade
            classes and then I was introduced to the brass family. Learning how to play a big slidy
            instrument called a trombone sparked something within me and that I felt already at
            home. I polished my skills throughout the early years and then I was invited to join the
            high school marching band when I was only 12 years old in 7th grade. It was a huge
            commitment to be performing for such a group at my age but I was determined to refine my
            skills even more and make new friends. I was in the marching band for 6 long years and I
            will never forget the memories I made with my friends and the things I have witnessed
            and experienced. This website is broadening my knowledge of the digital world and it
            will show what I'm learning in my current classes as well as a resume that will show
            those who are interested in my abilities. Thanks for viewing my site!</p>
