        <h1>My Portfolio</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my personal portfolio for DIGIT 100!</p>

        <p>Here is a sample link to another website outside of this site. This link holds an
                <dfn>absolute URL</dfn>
            <a href="https://behrend.psu.edu/">Penn State Erie, The Behrend College</a>.</p>
        <p>But here is a link to another page inside my website: this is a :
            <a href="innerPage.html"><dfn>relative URL</dfn></a></p>
        <!--ebb: The <img> element holds information from a separate image file, stored in the images directory inside the website directory. 
       The HTML <img> element pulls that image file into the page. You can write styling code with CSS to control relatively how much space it will take up in the browser window.

        <h2>A list of my <dfn>favorite</dfn> seasons!</h2>
       
        <ol>

        <h3>A <strong>third-level</strong> heading just to see what that looks like</h3>
        <p>HTML code has <em>lower-level</em> headings like from h2 to h6, but use them in order as
            you create subsections! You can control the size, position, color, font, and more of
            headings (and any HTML display elements) using CSS.</p>
        <p>When should I use <b>bold</b> vs. <strong>strong</strong> in HTML code? These are
                <dfn>inline</dfn> elements.</p>
        <p> Other HTML elements like the <dfn>p</dfn> (for paragraph) or the heading level elements,
            or ordered and unorderd lists, or img elements make blocks on the page and are known as
                <dfn>block</dfn> elements. </p><h2>An unordered list of amphibians</h2>
