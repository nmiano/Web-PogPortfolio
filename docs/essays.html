        <h1>My Essay </h1>
        <p>One of the most significant challenges for a new learner is learning the code and learning how to apply said code for you to achieve what you want for your website. The advantage of using Oxygen XML is the author view because you are easily able to view what you have done within the code. As of right now with my current knowledge I think that oxygen is hard to navigate but maybe that is just since I am blind when it comes to looking for things I need. Anyways, the skills that are necessary in order to develop these sites are adaptation skills, reading skills, interpretation and analysis. These are just a few of the skill you will most likely need in order to be at least a learner of coding and website development but there are many more you might not necessarily need to have but would be nice, like art skills and design. The skills that I want to learn personally are those that help me understand how to apply the knowledge I gain into my own work. It would also be nice to understand code a lot better as if it were an easy second language. </p>
