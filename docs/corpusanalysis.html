       <p>The texts that I will be using for this corpus analysis will be "Frankenstein" by Mary Shelley and "Dracula" by Bram Stoker. I want to start this analysis by comparing these texts in Antconc and see the comparisons of N-grams and their frequencies throughout. Initially, I see that the most common N-gram is "I could not." </p>

        <p>Looking through the sentences that have the N-Gram "I could not," I could see that the phrase is a lot more prevalent in Dracula then Frankenstein. </p>

        <p>My prediction was correct and the phrase "I could not" is about 2x's more prevalent in Dracula than in Frankenstein.</p>
        <p>What I found interesting about this N-Gram is that the phrse 'I could see' is only found in the text Dracula. I found that really interesting because it is such a common phrase and Frankenstein does not have it at all. This could possibly indicate that Frankenstein is not really first person orientated compared to Dracula.</p>

        <p>After this simple text analysis I want to shift gears over to Voyant tools and compare
            the frequency of words within each text and see if I can find anything that is
            interesting.</p>

        <p>A word that stood out to me right away that was prevalent in both word pools is the word
            "man." What I found that was super interesting is that the word in Frankenstein is
            mucher bigger than it is in Dracula but "man" in Dracula almost shows up double the
            amount of times then it does in Frankenstein! </p>

            <figcaption>Voyant Dracula (Left) Voyant Frankenstein (Right)</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>As you can see, the word "man" shows up 454 times in Dracula and 280 times in
            Frankenstein but the word in the word pool in Dracula is so much smaller than it is in
            Frankenstein. I believe that this indicates that the text Dracula must be larger than
            the text Frankenstein!</p>
