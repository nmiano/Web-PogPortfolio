        <h3>EXPERIENCE</h3> 
        
        <header>IHOP, 2933 W 12th St, Erie, PA 16505 Host/Dishwasher/Cook/Kitchen Maintenance
        March 2019 - Present</header>
       
        <p>As an IHOP Host I gained communication, management and customer
        service skills. I greeted guests at the front doors, lead guests to their seats,
        and managed guest locations to ensure servers had an equal amount of
        tables. While hosting, I would also ensure the dining room and restrooms
        looked their best at all times. I was promoted to cook and dishwasher
        where I gained valuable cooking experience and time management skills.
        Additionally, I stocked the shelves, cleaned dishes, and kept the kitchen
        organized and clean even during very busy times.</p>
        
        <header>Greek Fest, 4376 W Lake Rd, Erie, PA 16505 Dishwasher/Server/Kitchen Maintenance
        July 4 2019 - July 8, worked 77 hours</header>
       
        <p>Spent the long holiday weekend serving food, cleaning dishes, and cooking.
        Quickly learned all the people and processes needed to make an immediate
        impact. It was very busy and fast paced so I had to stay flexible and do
        whatever was needed to the best of my abilities. My boss told me I was the
        hardest working and most dedicated worker at the festival.</p>
