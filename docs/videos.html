        <p>This is my Youtube Channel! Yes, I know, theres not much to work with here but it is a work in progress. This channel will be showcasing some of the projects that I will be doing for my ART 168 class at Penn State Behrend. I have been having a bunch of fun navigating and figuring out how to edit using tools such as Adobe Photoshop and Premiere Pro! I can't wait to see what the future has in store for this channel and the content that will come from it. I hope you enjoy!</p>
