        <p>Friday Night Funkin’ is not focused on the aspect of exploring a world; instead, it is a
            game that focuses on progression. You initially start on the tutorial, but you must beat
            the game by going through the “weeks” and battling different people. The graphics in
            this game are clean. It is not like your top engine fps game with 4k graphics, but it
            holds its own, especially in the early development stages. I enjoy the art style, and it
            is super unique. The graphics in this game could run a little bit smoother, but other
            than that, the visuals in this game are minimal yet pleasing to see and experience. The
            settings are incomplete as of right now, unfortunately. Believe it or not, but the game
            does not even have a settings menu. That means that the volume you hear in the game is
            what it is stuck at, and you would have to change your volume accordingly on whatever
            headset or speaker you are using. The settings should include a home button, a more
            in-depth volume controller, and graphics settings based on what your computer can
            handle. When it comes to exploring the game, it is constrained, but it is still worth it
            to play the game. You can only explore from the starting screen to the screen where you
            can select “Story Mode,” “Free Play,” and “Donate.” The free play takes you to the main
            screen, where you can select the tutorial of the week you want to play. You can also
            navigate to the difficulty you want to play, as well as the available music you have the
            potential of playing and a “week score” to show how much you have played over a certain
            amount of time. Free play allows you to play any of the songs that you enjoyed playing
            when in the story mode and Donate allows you to support the creators and help them make
            this game even better! The only character you can play as is the main character who is
            trying to get a girlfriend. His name is “bf,” and you control him to fight musically
            against his GF’s family so they can be together. The details that make him very distinct
            from everyone else are the clothes he is wearing, the overall vibe he is portraying, and
            the voice that comes out of him when you sing against other opponents. There is not any
            singing in the game, but somewhat tones played at the right time when you must hit the
            right arrow key with the correct position. You cannot talk or interact with any of the
            characters. The only interaction you have with the characters is when you fight against
            them in their corresponding week or just in free play. The challenge of this game is to
            beat every person every week to get the girl of your dreams. The game is yet to be
            finished, and I expect many wore weeks to come out with new music and new characters to
            fight, but there is still a goal even with the limited weeks so far. You can quickly get
            stuck on a level if you cannot complete the song you are playing, and you lose against
            the character you are fighting. That takes you to a “death screen” where you can only
            continue to the same song and try to fight the same person again to beat them. This game
            is not very in-depth currently in the story. Instead, I highly believe that this game is
            way more focused on enjoying the music you are playing and having a good time. That does
            not mean there is no objective, as I have stated above, but I believe this game is more
            focused on enjoyability than the story. You cannot interact with nearly anything in the
            game. There are no star power-ups like in Guitar Hero; you only have a score and the
            fighting bar that shows how well you are doing against your opponent and that changes
            based on how well or how wrong you are doing. I honestly do not see any cultural issues
            portrayed through this game because that is not what the game is trying to show off.
            This game is a rhythm game, and it does not need to focus on issues in the outside
            world. Instead, a game that invites you to join its world. This game is not very
            self-aware either. I think the goal that the creators had in mind is that they want you
            to explore the levels and have fun listening to all the awesome music. The developers
            focus on how they want you to feel; they want you to escape reality and play an
            addictive game. They do not want you to have to worry about problems of the outside
            world, now that doesn’t mean they don’t support and help with any of the problems of the
            outside world, but they want you to enjoy yourself and have a great time playing Friday
            Night Funkin’ </p>
